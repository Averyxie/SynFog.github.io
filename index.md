## Insights
The paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |
